distributions
You always should use an official distribution from hydra to ensure your realm is up to date and protected
good practices
when editing the anti cheat you should always use random/unique tags in the anti cheat! hackers will likely develop nbt to attack the anti cheat, you should aim to make your distribution as unique as possible to avoid getting hijacked!

when editing and distributing your modifications
please credit us for providing the  foundation! you also must keep our credits in begin/credit the same!

module toggleing
some modules in hydra are not enabled to ensure good performance in-game, if you wish to enable further security heres a list of modules that you can enable ingame with a 
always active repeating command block:
modules/stability - helps to try to clear lag, will ban a user if extreme amounts of items are nearby
modules/NoRedstone - helps to prevent command/nbt placement by higher  skilled hackers, bans all redstone which typically is used to run nbt
modules/AntiDupe - bans items in-game to help prevent duplcation by hackers and non hackers, (recommended to enable for economy based servers)
modules/AntiMod_2 - bans throwable items like eggs,potions,arrows,snowballs
modules/GameShutdown - causes the mc client to crash, good for removing hackers who have a kick bypass(W.I.P)
modules/crystal - deletes end crystals ingame
modules/version - check the  anti cheat version
modules/NoEntitySpam - stops hackers from spamming entities, bans them if  constant spamming is occuring
suggest more features for us to implement in #🗣┇feature-request

basic setup
hydra doesnt require you to place a command block down to activate it
when you load up your mc world please run /function HydraInit to use hydra entirely

and your all set to go! enjoy using hydra!!!
tags
staff - hydra will ignore users with this tag(RECOMMENDED TO CHANGE)
delete - hydra will efficiently delete entities using delete, it is more effective than /kill

killing nbt
we recommend having every anti nbt function enabled in hydra heres the list
nbt_disabler should be ON
NoRedstone should be ON
AntiMod_2 should be ON
these will immensely help reduce greifs on your server, the tradeoff is that the majority of items/blocks such as bows, potions, pistons and ect will be banned
